#Introduction: This Case Study is about the Market Analysis of Beers and Breweries within the state of US

#The data set used for this case study analysis consists of 2 Datasets:

#Beers Dataset with 2410 Craft Beers along with their details about:
#Name: Name of the beer
#Beer_ID: Unique identifier of the beer
#ABV: Alcohol by volume of the beer
#IBU: International Bitterness Units of the beer
#Brewery_ID: Brewery id associated with the beer
#Style: Style of the beer
#Ounces: Ounces of beer

#Breweries Dataset with 558 Breweries across US along with their details about
#Name: Name of the brewery
#City: City where the brewery is located
#State: U.S. State where the brewery is located
#Brew_ID: Unique identifier of the brewery

#The goal of our team is to analyze the Beers market and present our analysis to the CEO & CFO of the Budweiser

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Breweries}
#Import the Breweries dataset
Breweries<-read.csv('C:/Sowmya/SMU/04_Doing Data Science/Unit-8 & Unit-9/Breweries.csv',header = TRUE)

#Quick Peek at the SUmmary data of the available dataset
summary(Breweries)
str(Breweries)

#Checking for Missing Data
sapply(Breweries,function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
gg_miss_var(Breweries)

#The Brewery dataset has 558  records with 4 variables providing more information on the different Breweries across the states of US.

#Find that the state variable had whitespaces on the left and would like to have it trimmed so we have a clean dataset.The dataset is ready to be merged with any dataset

Breweries$State = str_trim(Breweries$State)
str(Breweries)
summary(Breweries)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Brew Summary }

#8.Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA).  You decide to use KNN classification to investigate this relationship.  Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. You can of course assume your audience is comfortable with percentages … KNN is very easy to understand conceptually.

#ALE is brewed more than IPA in major breweries across the states of US.The volume of ALE brewed is more than IPA.12 ounce is brewed more than the 24 and 32 ounces. ALE is sold more than IPA in 12 ounces and IPA constitutes more than ALE in 16 ounces.Colorado & California are the major breweries that brew ALE and IPA across US.DC and Delaware are the states with the least breweries for ALE and IPA.The Mean IBU of IPA is 70 and ALE is 34.The Mean ABV of IPA is 6.8 and ALE is 5.6

#As this is an observational study there is no cause and effect but association to the conclusion.We cannot conclude that IPA is more sought out beer than ALE from the mean IBU and ABV values (pvalue <0.0005 from the knn and NB test).In conclusion the association between IBU and ABV can be generalized to identify IPA and ALE beer styles in the selected area of study in the US but cannot be generalized to other countries across the world.Though the production of ALE is more than IPA, we have enough evidence to suggest that the market for IPA is increasing and there is potential for business in the states of US
